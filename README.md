# Task 4
# Weather Data Analysis & Visualization

A beginner-friendly project that demonstrates loading, cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing weather data using Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib.

# Project Overview

This project analyzes a simple weather dataset containing monthly temperature, humidity, and rainfall values.
It includes:

Data loading

Data cleaning

Summary statistics

Multiple visualizations

Final analytical report

Insights based on the charts

This project is part of a learning module on data visualization (Week 4).

# Dataset Used

File: weather_data.csv

Columns included:

Month

Avg_Temperature

Humidity

Rainfall_mm

# Technologies Used

Python

Pandas

Matplotlib

Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab

# How to Run This Project

1. Install Required Library
   
pip install pandas matplotlib

2. Download the dataset

Place weather_data.csv in the same folder as your notebook or script.

3. Run the Notebook

Open your .ipynb file using:

Google Colab

Jupyter Notebook

VS Code

# Visualizations Included
✔ Line Chart – Temperature Trend

Shows how temperature changes across 12 months.

✔ Line Chart – Monthly Humidity

Illustrates humidity pattern through the year.

✔ Bar Chart – Monthly Rainfall

Helps compare rainfall levels across months.

✔ Pie Chart – Rainfall Distribution

Represents the share of total rainfall for each month.

# Analysis Performed

Basic dataset inspection

Checking missing values

Calculating descriptive statistics

Identifying:

Hottest month

Coldest month

Most humid month

Least humid month

Total rainfall

# Final Report Highlights

The notebook prints a summary including:

Total rainfall in a year

Highest temperature and month

Lowest temperature and month

Peak and lowest humidity months

Data-driven insights

# Key Insights

June is the hottest month.

January is the coldest month.

December has the highest humidity.

Rainfall is concentrated in the last few months of the year.

Weather patterns reflect clear seasonal behavior.

# Future Enhancements

Add multi-year weather data

Create temperature vs. humidity correlation heatmap

Build a Streamlit weather dashboard

Add seasonal classification using machine learning
